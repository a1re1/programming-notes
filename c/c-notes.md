# C Basics
## Variables and Data Types:
C is statically typed; types are known at compile time
C is also weakly typed; types can be changed using typecasting
Types can be misused

## Basic Scalar types:
|type	|description	|size|
|---|---|---|
|int	|Integers	|4 bytes*|
|float	|floating point	|4 bytes|
|double	|floating point	|8 bytes|
|char	|ascii char	|1 byte|
|bool	|c99 added 1bit boolean	|4 bytes|
|void*	|address	|4/8 bytes|

*depends on architecture 64bit vs 32bit

## Type specifiers:
	- There is a tradeoff between representational capacity of a variable and the memory requirement
	- Three axes:
		â—‹ size, sign, scope

|type	|min size|
|---|---|
|short int |2 byte|
|int	|4 bytes*
|long int	|8 bytes
|long double	|8/16 bytes*|

8 bits = 1 byte
an 8-bit integer type has 256 possible combinations bitwise
integer types have a signed bit by default

## Control flow:
	- if statements
	- switch statements
	- ternary statements
	- goto statements

The only false value in C is 0; NULL is also zero; false

Switch statements operate in O(1) time and allow fall through

IO is buffered by enter character in C

CTRL-C kill program	CTRL-D EOF (End of File) symbol

Ternary operator
(<condition>)?(<if-true>):(<if-false>)

Goto
labal:
goto label;

C has a sizeof operator to find out size of types for a system

User defined types; and defined types are extra types in C:
	ex:
		- size_t x = sizeof(int)
		- print with %zu

The size of a pointer depends on the architecture
	64-bit uses 8 bytes; 32-bit uses 4 bytes

static -- makes global vars private to a file, and makes local variables persist across calls
const -- promise to compiler that value will not change

Switch statements will goto code to execute then proceed to run everything afterwards; end code block with break statement

Iteration is normal:
	for loops;
	while loops;
	do {<statements>} while (<condition>);

	continue -- skip rest of iteration and go to next cycle
	break -- get out of loop

echo {input} | {program}	simulate sending input by piping into the program

look up any C function with: man {function}

## Arrays
	- Arrays are composite data types
	- elements of an array are contiguous in memory
	- an array variable contains the address of the first element
	- cannot be returned from functions
  - cannot be resized

# Arrays Uses
Commandline Argments
int main(int argc, char **argv){...}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){...}

|g	|o	|o	|d	|\0|
|a	|r	|e	|\0|
|d	|o	|g	|s	\0|
|m	|i	|m	|i	|c	|\0|

3 - 2- 1 - 0 : Array positions top - bottom
\0 is Nul Character

**Not generally a good idea to use sizeof() on an array
**Printf stops when it sees nul terminator in an array
you can use quotation marks (") to uses spaces in command line arguments

`` used for bash substitution in command line arguments

single quotes (' ') are used for characters instead of strings

ASCII value of Nul is 0

## Pointer Arithmetic
Pointers store addresses so adding a number to an address will start at the initial address plus the arithmetic operation

fgets(buffer, buffsize, stdin);

io redirection | piping data into the stdin of a program

strtol(string, NULL, {base});	str to long we use base 10

int main(void) {
	int x, y;
	char buffer[100];

	printf("enter first number: "
	fgets(buffer, 100, stdin);
	x = strtol(buffer, NULL, 10);
	printf("number was %d. \n", x);

	printf("enter second number: ");
	fgets(buffer, 100, stdin);
	y = strtol(buffer, NULL, 10);
	printf("number was %d. \n", y);

	printf("product is %d", x *y);
}

strtol stops on non numbers
